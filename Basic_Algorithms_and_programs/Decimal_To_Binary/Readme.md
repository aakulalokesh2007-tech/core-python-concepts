Recursion can be a mind-bender, but it is incredibly elegant once it clicks.
By calling the function within itself (DecimalToBinary(num // 2)),
I am using Python's built-in Call Stack to essentially "store" my remainders.
When the base case is reached, the stack "unwinds,
  " printing the modulo remainders (num % 2) in the exact perfect order—completely eliminating the need to manually reverse a string!
